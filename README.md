# Learning Sprint Framework

A framework for structuring 2-week learning sprints with daily progress tracking.

## Core Concepts

### Sprint
A Sprint is a 2-week focused period for learning a specific topic. Each sprint:
- Has a clear title and goal description
- Tracks daily progress
- Runs for exactly 14 days
- Maintains stats like streaks and completion rate

### Daily Progress
Each day during a sprint, you track:
- What progress you made
- When you worked (morning/afternoon/evening)
- How your flow state was (deep flow/steady/stuck)
- Optional reflection notes

### Terminology
- Use "Sprint" (not "Project" or "Path")
- Use "Progress" (not "Ship" or "Deliverable")
- Use "Flow" for effectiveness states (deep flow/steady/stuck)
- Track "Streaks" for consecutive days with progress
